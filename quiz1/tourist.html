In fact, this dance has often been performed annually since 2011 through the Gandrung Sewu Festival. If this year the festival is not held due to a pandemic, you can still see the mad dance through a thousand gandrung statues in the Terracotta Gandrung Park. The statue is made using earthenware. If you want to take a photo with a statue, you have to be careful because the patnung is fragile and breaks easily. Even though many statues are in one place, you can also see the infatuated statue on the lip of the pool near the rice fields. This tourist spot is located at the foot of Mount Ijen. Precisely in the Jiwa Jawa Ijen Resort area, Licin District.</a>
